- 9. Write a function which receives an array and a number as arguments and returns a new array from
     the elements of the given array which are larger than the given number.

  ### [Task's solution](https://github.com/ElenGhazaryann/Functions/blob/main/t9_biggerNum.js)

- 11. Write a function, which receives two numbers as arguments and finds all numbers between them such that each digit of the number is even. The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-
      separated sequence on a single line.

  ### [Task's solution](https://github.com/ElenGhazaryann/Functions/blob/main/t11_evenDigits.js)

- 14. Write a function, which receives an array as an argument which elements arrays of numbers. Find
      product of biggest negative number of each array. If there is not any negative number, ignore that array. Check that items of the given array are arrays.
